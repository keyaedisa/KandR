# K and R Home

*got real messy all of a sudden. will organize when i feel like it*

This is where I have pushed all my K and R work that I was working on locally to github in order to keep track of progress better.
This is where I will be beginning my year of code.

Good luck have fun. Don't give up. You can do this.
You are the only thing keeping yourself from success.
