# K and R Home

This is where I have pushed all my K and R work that I was working on locally to github in order to keep track of progress better.


Good luck have fun. Don't give up. You can do this.
You are the only thing keeping yourself from success.

# MISC

Starting 1.13 I decided to commit to not looking at solutions until after I successfully accomplished what I believed the book was asking me to do. This caused me to get really burnt out while I adjusted and so I skipped 1.13 and 1.14 due to overcomplicating things so much that I realized I would have to likely start from scratch to complete it.

I am very proud of the solutions I have produced since.
